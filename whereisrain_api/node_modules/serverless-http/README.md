# serverless-http

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dougmoscrop/serverless-http.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dougmoscrop/serverless-http)

## Description

This module allows you to 'wrap' your API for serverless use. No HTTP server, no ports or sockets. Just your code in the same execution pipeline you are already familiar with.

## Support

### Supported Frameworks

* Connect
* Express
* Koa
* Sails (experimental)
* Hapi (experimental)

### Supported Providers

* AWS

## Usage

```javascript
const serverless = require('serverless-http');
const koa = require('koa'); // or any supported framework

const app = koa();

app.use(/* register your middleware as normal */);

// this is it!
module.exports.handler = serverless(app);
// or as a promise
const handler = serverless(app);
module.exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  return await handler(event, context);
};
```

## Limitations

Your code is running in a serverless environment. You cannot rely on your server being 'up' in the sense that you can/should not use in-memory sessions, web sockets, etc. You are also subject to provider specific restrictions on request/response size, duration, etc.

> Think of this as a familiar way of expressing your app logic, *not* trying to make serverless do something it cannot.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Especially test scenarios for different situations and configurations.
